<h4>Overview</h4>
Weather Vue is a solo project developed over 5 days to create a user-friendly weather app that provides live weather information for any location worldwide. This project is an ongoing effort, with continuous improvements and feature additions planned for the future.

<h4>Features</h4>
Current weather information for any location.
Ongoing project with planned features for a 5-day forecast and hourly forecast.
Improvements I Could've Done
One notable improvement that could be implemented is the addition of a 5-day forecast and an hourly forecast. These features would enhance the app's utility, providing users with more comprehensive weather information for better planning.

<h4>Struggles</h4>
During the development of Weather Vue, I encountered a challenge related to displaying the date. Initially, I used date().toLocaleString(), but the issue arose when the time displayed was in my local time. This caused a problem when users viewed the weather for a different city, as the time wouldn't reflect their local time. To address this, I filtered the display to show only the day, overcoming the issue and ensuring accurate time representation for users worldwide.

<h4>Wins</h4>
One of the significant achievements in this project is the successful integration of data from two APIs. This integration allows Weather Vue to provide real-time weather updates for any location globally. The use of multiple APIs contributes to the app's reliability and accuracy in delivering live weather information.

<h4>Future Plans</h4>
Weather Vue is an evolving project, and future updates will focus on enhancing the user experience and expanding the app's functionality. Planned features include a 5-day forecast and an hourly forecast, providing users with more in-depth weather insights.

<h4>How to Use</h4>
To use Weather Vue, simply enter the desired location in the search bar and press enter. The app will then display the current weather conditions for the specified location.
